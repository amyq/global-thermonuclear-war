<h2 id="components">Product components</h2>

<p id="lift">[acquia-product:cha] includes the following components to help you better engage with your website visitors:</p>

<ul>
 <li class="margin-top-1em"><strong class="font-big"><a href="/lift/drupal">[acquia-product:leb]</a></strong>
  <p><img alt="[acquia-product:leb] logo" class="no-sb logo-pp" src="/sites/docs.acquia.com/files/product-icons/lift-Experience-Builder.png" width="40px" />Instead of having to use a separate application with its own interface and API to target content to your customers, [acquia-product:cha] features a collection of modules that integrates tightly with Drupal, allowing you to leverage the Drupal skills and knowledge you've developed from maintaining your website. Using these modules, you can create personalizations that target your website's content to the segments you create using [acquia-product:lpm], even if some of your websites aren't using Drupal.</p>
 </li>

 <li class="margin-top-1em"><strong class="font-big"><a href="/lift/drupal/web">[acquia-product:lpm]</a></strong>
  <p><img alt="[acquia-product:lpm] logo" class="no-sb logo-pp"  src="/sites/docs.acquia.com/files/product-icons/lift-Profile-Manager-final.png" width="40px" />As a cloud-based application separate from your website, [acquia-product:lpm] lets you search for and categorize data about each of your visitors, based on customizable criteria such as location or the content type the visitor has viewed most frequently. [acquia-product:lpm] allows you to organize this data into segments, or groups of criteria that visitors often have in common. For example, if your website specializes in vacation packages, a visitor who clicks on a skiing vacation might fit into a predefined <em>Sports Enthusiast</em> segment. You can also create JavaScript-based slots, or customizable placeholders, on your website to drag and drop customized content that can target those specific users.</p>
 </li>
 
  <li class="margin-top-1em"><strong class="font-big"><a href="/content-hub">[acquia-product:ch]</a></strong>
  <p><img alt="[acquia-product:ch] logo" class="no-sb logo-pp" src="/sites/default/files/doc/2015/oct/content-hub-logo-sm.png" width="40px" />[acquia-product:ch] is a cloud-based, centralized content distribution and syndication solution that provides you with the ability to share and enrich content throughout a network of content sources (including Drupal websites) with extensible, open APIs. It is a high-performance, scalable offering that connects content bidirectionally across multiple systems. It enables enterprises that operate many digital properties to effectively publish, reuse, and syndicate content across a variety of content sources and publishing channels.</p>
 </li>
</ul>


<h2 id="features">Additional features</h2>

<p>Depending on the [acquia-product:cha] package that you select, you can also access the [acquia-product:ldb] functionality, which provides the following features:</p>

<ul>
 <li><strong><a href="/lift/omni">Data warehouse</a></strong> - Using this feature, you can integrate data from other systems (such as marketing automation or CRM) into [acquia-product:cha] profiles by using a dedicated connection to <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/redshift/">Amazon Redshift</a>. This cloud-based data warehouse contains all of your [acquia-product:cha]-hosted visitor data, and with this direct access, you can use your own business intelligence tools to analyze your website visitors and discover new insights.</li> 
  <li><strong><a href="/lift/omni/api">APIs</a></strong> - [acquia-product:ldb] includes access to several [acquia-product:cha] APIs that you can use to exchange your visitor data with other systems.</li>
  <li><strong>Optional additional connectors</strong> - An [acquia-product:ldb] subscription enables you to connect to other systems that contain user and sales information. Currently, [acquia-product:cha] officially supports the <a href="/lift/drupal/web/admin/connectors">Marketo</a> connector.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
</ul>


<h2 id="browser">Browser requirements</h2>

<p>[acquia-product:cha] supports the current and prior major releases of the Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Safari web browsers for capturing visitor data and displaying personalized content. The [acquia-product:leb] administrative sidebar is supported for Chrome and Firefox.</p>
