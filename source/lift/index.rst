Product components
------------------

|lift| includes the following components to help you
better engage with your website visitors:


-  **`|leb| <http://docs.acquia.com/lift/drupal>`_**

   |leb logo|\ Instead of having to use a separate
   application with its own interface and API to target content to your
   customers, |lift| features a collection of modules that
   integrates tightly with Drupal, allowing you to leverage the Drupal
   skills and knowledge you've developed from maintaining your website.
   Using these modules, you can create personalizations that target your
   website's content to the segments you create using
   |lpm|, even if some of your websites aren't using
   Drupal.

-  **`|lpm| <http://docs.acquia.com/lift/drupal/web>`_**

   |lpm logo|\ As a cloud-based application separate
   from your website, |lpm| lets you search for and
   categorize data about each of your visitors, based on customizable
   criteria such as location or the content type the visitor has viewed
   most frequently. |lpm| allows you to organize this
   data into segments, or groups of criteria that visitors often have in
   common. For example, if your website specializes in vacation
   packages, a visitor who clicks on a skiing vacation might fit into a
   predefined *Sports Enthusiast* segment. You can also create
   JavaScript-based slots, or customizable placeholders, on your website
   to drag and drop customized content that can target those specific
   users.

-  **`|hub| <http://docs.acquia.com/content-hub>`__**

   |ch logo|\ |hub| is a cloud-based,
   centralized content distribution and syndication solution that
   provides you with the ability to share and enrich content throughout
   a network of content sources (including Drupal websites) with
   extensible, open APIs. It is a high-performance, scalable offering
   that connects content bidirectionally across multiple systems. It
   enables enterprises that operate many digital properties to
   effectively publish, reuse, and syndicate content across a variety of
   content sources and publishing channels.

Additional features
-------------------

Depending on the |lift| package that you select, you can
also access the [acquia-product:ldb] functionality, which provides the
following features:

-  **`Data warehouse <http://docs.acquia.com/lift/omni>`__** - Using this feature, you can
   integrate data from other systems (such as marketing automation or
   CRM) into |lift| profiles by using a dedicated
   connection to `Amazon Redshift <http://aws.amazon.com/redshift/>`__.
   This cloud-based data warehouse contains all of your
   |lift|-hosted visitor data, and with this direct
   access, you can use your own business intelligence tools to analyze
   your website visitors and discover new insights.
-  **`APIs <http://docs.acquia.com/lift/omni/api>`__** - [acquia-product:ldb] includes access
   to several |lift| APIs that you can use to exchange
   your visitor data with other systems.
-  **Optional additional connectors** - An |ldb|
   subscription enables you to connect to other systems that contain
   user and sales information. Currently, |lift|
   officially supports the
   `Marketo <http://docs.acquia.com/lift/drupal/web/admin/connectors>`__ connector.

Browser requirements
--------------------

|lift| supports the current and prior major releases of
the Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Safari web browsers for
capturing visitor data and displaying personalized content. The
|leb| administrative sidebar is supported for Chrome and
Firefox.
