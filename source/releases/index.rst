Release Notes for Acquia Cloud
=============


.. I attempted to do a "latest stable release" as seen on http://kylo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/release-notes/ReleaseNotes.html but there is no way I can see to do a toctree directive and only return one result. Failing that, you have to provide the latest-release manually. I suggest we not do that. Let's make these pages just be a list of release notes that auto-update when new ones are added.
